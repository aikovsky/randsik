The big thing that I'm thinking of right now is where to draw the line with this library.
Should it also include a CLI with a full featured, "select your MIDI" out device kind of
thing? Or should it just include this "generate" function and that's it.

I'm thinking of jamming a bunch of stuff in to this library, but the cool thing is that it
will still be fairly modular as the only requirement necessary will be the Mido library.

meh.

### Goals

I want to be able to launch a CLI program that will start sending random MIDI notes to 
the device that I select.
